# Seed
Simple project scaffolding with git tags

1. Create ~/.seedlist file - should contain list of filesystem paths to git repos
2. Tag (annotated) some commits with tags starting with "seed" (seed-bower-angular, seed-python-django)
3. Use ```seed list``` to list all available seeds
4. Use ```seed plant <seed_id> <target_dir>``` to plant a seed
5. Grow it
